    Why should someone buy a discord bot when there are free bots in the
    internet that are safe and reliable: Well all bots made by CursedBots.inc
    are all open sourced so there is no sneaking around. Buying a bot from us
    means that it is YOUR bot not someone else's, you can freely customize it
    and make it into something you love. Why are all your plans monthly
    payments? Our plans are monthly payments because we host the bot on our own
    servers and we do regular maintenance such as clearing user and server cache
    aswell as updating code blocks with each language update. Why should I pay
    you if I can make one on my own? There is no reason you would have to pay us
    if you want to make your own we are ok with that the reason we are here is
    so that anyone who want a bot of their own but doesnt have the time needed
    to develop it we are here to do so. Why are your plans so expensive? we have
    actually based our plan pricing on top competitors in this field so instead
    of paying $45 USD a month for the same service you could instead pay $15 USD
    and have a guarantee your bot stays online and up to date without having to
    pay any extra fees. Your money is always out to good use when paying for a
    discord bot. <strong> Buy today the CursedWay</strong></font>

<h2>Information Section</h2>
<p>
  <strong> <font size="+2">here is a detailed description of who we are </strong>
  CursedBots is a small team of developers and just friends that was created by
  me, Hi my name is Tj I'm 16 years old and I'm most know as CursedBotsDev
  officialpixels and more names I started CursedBots when I first started making
  my discord bot ServerAdmin#5240 that was back in mid 2021 over time I am
  adding new people to the team whether your a developer or you just have some
  really good ideas and can make someone laugh it doesnt matter your an
  essential part of the team right now as this page is updated on
  <strong> Thursday March 31st, 2022 </strong> there are 2 members in this team Me
  and my good friend pop plays who originally made this website on his own
  because I didnt know html and I was a peice of shit, but dont be disappointed
  or alarmed I have changed alot in the past few months and I'm developing full
  time as I used to do it as a hobby. Now I am no genius but I do no the
  difference between knowledge and wisdom here is a quote my uncle told me one
  day that I'll never forget
  <strong>
    "Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit but wisdom is not putting it in a
    fruit salad"
  </strong>
  he told me that quote almost 3 years ago and I still live by it to this day
  now I'm not here to tell you my life story I am only here to tell you about
    us</font>
